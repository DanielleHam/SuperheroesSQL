# Assignment SQL

This project contains two main parts. The superheroes database and the Chinook CRUD repository C# project.

## Superheroes

The superheroes database has nine files contained within the superheroes folder, running these in order will create a database that has tables for superheroes, their powers and their assistants.

## Chinook

The Chinook project contains a C# project that communicates with a database for managing a program that sells music, similar to iTunes. With the C# project the user can read information on users, either by ID, by Name, by finding all users, or by finding a limited section of all users. The user can add new users and update existing ones. It can also sort the countries based on how many customers are from there, sort customers based on how much they've spent and get a customers favourite genre(s).
